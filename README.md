Chromium Embedded Framework Simple Application
==============================================
A simple hello world application to get you started with CEF.

It setups a browser, loads a local file and binds JS methods.

This is the WithoutBinaries branch, which does not include CEF dlls and dylibs nor include files.
If you want those as well, switch to WithBinaries branches.
Also, take a look at that branch to see how the files are organized if you want to use your own files without change the project settings.
